**COMPANY** CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME** PRADNYA BHAGWAN PAWAR

**INTERN ID** CT08FVW

**DOMAIN** VLSI

**BATCH DURATION** December 25th, 2024 to January 25th, 2025.

**MENTOR NAME** NEELA SANTHOSH

# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK
Objective:

To design and simulate a  ALU using Verilog that performs a predefined set of arithmetic and logical operations.
Operations Implemented:
Arithmetic Operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication (optional for more advanced ALUs)
Division (optional for more advanced ALUs)
Increment/Decrement
Logical Operations:
AND
OR
AND NOT

Inputs:
Two operands (A and B), typically 4-bit or 8-bit binary numbers.
A control signal or opcode for specifying the operation to be carried out, like addition, which has a code 000, or subtraction, with code 001.
Outputs
Result of operation
Status signal like carry, overflow, zero, or sign flags to signify specific conditions.
Components
Control Unit: The opcode is decoded to choose the correct operation.
Arithmetic Circuit: Add, subtract, etc
Logic Circuit: Used for the execution of bit-level operations, such as AND, OR, and XOR
Shift Unit: Implementation of shifting
Testing and Verification
Testbench written in Verilog simulating the design of the ALU.
Give different input combinations (A, B) and control signals.
Check the output against the expected results.
